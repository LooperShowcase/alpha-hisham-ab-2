      Apple Inc. is an American multinational technology company that
      specializes in consumer electronics, computer software and online
      services. Apple is the largest information technology company by revenue
      (totaling $274.5 billion in 2020) and, since January 2021, the world's
      most valuable company. As of 2021, Apple is the fourth-largest PC vendor
      by unit sales[9] and fourth-largest smartphone manufacturer.[10][11] It is
      one of the Big Five American information technology companies, alongside
      Amazon, Google (Alphabet), Facebook (Meta), and Microsoft.[12][13][14]
      Apple was founded in 1976 by Steve Jobs, Steve Wozniak and Ronald Wayne to
      develop and sell Wozniak's Apple I personal computer. It was incorporated
      by Jobs and Wozniak as Apple Computer, Inc. in 1977, and sales of its
      computers, among them the Apple II, grew quickly. It went public in 1980,
      to instant financial success. Over the next few years, Apple shipped new
      computers featuring innovative graphical user interfaces, such as the
      original Macintosh, announced in a critically acclaimed advertisement,
      "1984", directed by Ridley Scott. The high cost of its products and
      limited application library caused problems, as did power struggles
      between executives. In 1985, Wozniak departed Apple amicably,[15] while
      Jobs resigned to found NeXT, taking some Apple employees with him.[16]
